The objective of the game is to score 100 points before your opponent. Players take turns rolling a single six-sided die:

1. On each turn, a player rolls the die by clicking the "Roll Dice" button.
2. The number rolled on the die is added to the player's current score for that turn.
3. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all points accumulated during that turn. The turn then passes to the next player.
4. If the player chooses to "Hold", their current turn score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
5. The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.
